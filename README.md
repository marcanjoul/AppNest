# AppNest: Your AI-Powered Internship & Job Tracker

AppNest is an AI-powered iOS app with Firebase backend, using MVVM architecture to separate UI, logic, and data. It automates and streamlines your job and internship search. When you apply to a job and receive a confirmation email, AppNest detects it, parses the details using AI, adds it to your tracker, and notifies you â€” all automatically. Additionally, it has the ability to manually add a past job, or even paste a job applied to from an email! An effort made by me to enhance my developer knowledge in order to be ready for SWE internships.


> Designed to be the ultimate job search companion for students and early-career professionals.
